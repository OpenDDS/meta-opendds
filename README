The layer contains three recipes for OpenDDS: two versioned, one not.

The versioned receipes are for OpenDDS 3.14 and 3.20, include
the following in your local.conf 

  PREFERRED_VERSION_opendds = "3.20" and optionally set ACE_TAO_OPTION to one of the following:
  ACE_TAO_OPTION = ""             to build with OCI ACE/TAO 2.2a with the latest patches
  ACE_TAO_OPTION = "--doc-group"  to build with the DOC Group ACE 6.5.16 / TAO 2.5.16 or later in the ACE 6.x / TAO 2.x series
  ACE_TAO_OPTION = "--doc-group3" to build with the DOC Group ACE 7.0.5 / TAO 3.0.5 or later in the ACE 7.x / TAO 3.x series

  PREFERRED_VERSION_opendds = "3.14" and optionally set ACE_TAO_OPTION to one of the following:
  ACE_TAO_OPTION = ""             to build with OCI ACE/TAO 2.2a with the latest patches
  ACE_TAO_OPTION = "--doc-group"  to build with the DOC Group ACE 6.5.16 / TAO 2.5.16 or later in the ACE 6.x / TAO 2.x series
  
The unversioned recipe  is provided to allow clients, via a bbappend, to
build - for example - the HEAD of the master branch or some other version.

To use this unversioned recipe, add the following to your local.conf or
distro configuration file.


    PREFERRED_VERSION_opendds="1.0+git%"
    PREFERRED_VERSION_opendds-native="1.0+git%"
    PREFERRED_VERSION_nativesdk-opendds="1.0+git%"
    

Note that simply providing a different branch and SRCREV may be insufficient.
If your desired commit is significantly newer than that used for the versioned
recipe, then the generic build instructions may be insufficient or incorrect.
