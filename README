II. Misc
========

The layer contains two recipes for OpenDDS: one versioned and one not.

If PREFERRED_VERSION is not specifed in your local.conf then the OpenDDS 3.24 recipe will be
selected for build by default

The versioned recipe will download and build with DOC Group ACE/TAO v2 by default.
To build the versioned recipe with DOC Group ACE/TAO v3 add the following to your local.conf
    
    ACE_TAO_OPTION = "--doc-group3"
  
The unversioned recipe is provided to allow clients, via a bbappend, to
build - for example - the HEAD of the master branch or some other version.

To use this unversioned recipe, add the following to your local.conf or
distro configuration file.


    PREFERRED_VERSION_opendds="1.0+git%"
    PREFERRED_VERSION_opendds-native="1.0+git%"
    PREFERRED_VERSION_nativesdk-opendds="1.0+git%"
    

Note that simply providing a different branch and SRCREV may be insufficient.
If your desired commit is significantly newer than that used for the versioned
recipe, then the generic build instructions may be insufficient or incorrect.
