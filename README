The layer contains three recipes for OpenDDS: two versioned, one not.

To select the versioned recipes for OpenDDS 3.24, 3.22, 3.20 or 3.14, include
the following in your local.conf 

  PREFERRED_VERSION_opendds = "3.24" and optionally set ACE_TAO_OPTION to one of the following:
  ACE_TAO_OPTION = ""             to build with OCI DOC Group ACE 6.5.19 / TAO 2.5.19
  ACE_TAO_OPTION = "--doc-group"  to build with the DOC Group ACE 6.5.19 / TAO 2.5.19
  ACE_TAO_OPTION = "--doc-group3" to build with the DOC Group ACE 7.1.0 / TAO 3.1.0

  PREFERRED_VERSION_opendds = "3.22" and optionally set ACE_TAO_OPTION to one of the following:
  ACE_TAO_OPTION = ""             to build with OCI ACE/TAO 2.2a with the latest patches
  ACE_TAO_OPTION = "--doc-group"  to build with the DOC Group ACE 6.5.18 / TAO 2.5.18
  ACE_TAO_OPTION = "--doc-group3" to build with the DOC Group ACE 7.0.8 / TAO 3.0.8

  PREFERRED_VERSION_opendds = "3.20" and optionally set ACE_TAO_OPTION to one of the following:
  ACE_TAO_OPTION = ""             to build with OCI ACE/TAO 2.2a with the latest patches
  ACE_TAO_OPTION = "--doc-group"  to build with the DOC Group ACE 6.5.16 / TAO 2.5.16
  ACE_TAO_OPTION = "--doc-group3" to build with the DOC Group ACE 7.0.5 / TAO 3.0.5

  PREFERRED_VERSION_opendds = "3.14" and optionally set ACE_TAO_OPTION to one of the following:
  ACE_TAO_OPTION = ""             to build with OCI ACE/TAO 2.2a with the latest patches
  ACE_TAO_OPTION = "--doc-group"  to build with DOC Group ACE 6.5.8 / TAO 2.5.8

If PREFERRED_VERSION is not specifed in your local.conf then the OpenDDS 3.22 recipe will be
selected for build by default due to it having a higher version number and when ACE_TAO_OPTION
is not defined the OCI ACE/TAO 2.2a with the latest patches option will be selected by default.
  
The unversioned recipe  is provided to allow clients, via a bbappend, to
build - for example - the HEAD of the master branch or some other version.

To use this unversioned recipe, add the following to your local.conf or
distro configuration file.


    PREFERRED_VERSION_opendds="1.0+git%"
    PREFERRED_VERSION_opendds-native="1.0+git%"
    PREFERRED_VERSION_nativesdk-opendds="1.0+git%"
    

Note that simply providing a different branch and SRCREV may be insufficient.
If your desired commit is significantly newer than that used for the versioned
recipe, then the generic build instructions may be insufficient or incorrect.
