II. Misc
========

The layer contains two recipes for OpenDDS: one versioned, one not.

The unversioned recipe  is provided to allow clients, via a bbappend, to
build - for example - the HEAD of the master branch or some other version.

To use this unversioned recipe, add the following to your local.conf or
distro configuration file.


    PREFERRED_VERSION_opendds="1.0+git%"
    PREFERRED_VERSION_opendds-native="1.0+git%"
    PREFERRED_VERSION_nativesdk-opendds="1.0+git%"

Note that simply providing a different branch and SRCREV may be insufficient.
If your desired commit is significantly newer than that used for the versioned
recipe, then the generic build instructions may be insufficient or incorrect.
